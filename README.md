# Hangman
A basic letter guessing word game in C

Current known bugs:  
Number of incorrect guesses undercounts in some instances  

Current known missing features:

Standaradized wordbank  

# Purpose
The goal of this project was to develop and expand my capabilities in the C language after taking various online courses. Concepts included file input, standard input/output, memory allocation, pointers/arrays, string manipulation, and basic logic/flow control. A secondary goal was to continue learning the non-programming side of project building, such as using GitHub properly, keeping track of changes and bug fixes, and documenting the coding process.
